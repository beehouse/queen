A radical experiment in community. Beehouse is a salon for the modern age: a hacker space, self-organized caf√©, art gallery, and library. We host events at Beehouse when the inspiration strikes. 

Collaborators at Beehouse are innovators and future leaders from the creative industries - technology, art, design, science, literature - and span academia and industry. Participation in Beehouse is invite-only, curated by the Business Queen and Hacker-in-Residence. 

Beehouse works closely with hackNY fellows, Tech Collab NYC collegiate leaders, and Flawless.tech participants.
